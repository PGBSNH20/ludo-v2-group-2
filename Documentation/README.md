## General Overview
We decided to use the Ludo Engine from the old project (from the database access course) some of the [database tables](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-group-2/blob/main/Documentation/ERDiagramLudo.png) were changed so it fits this project better.

## [Controllers](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-group-2/blob/main/Documentation/Crontrollers.md)
We made different controllers according to the [tables](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-group-2/blob/main/Documentation/ERDiagramLudo.png) we have on the Ludo Engine, We need all the controllers in order to get/post/patch/delete information in the database.

## Docker-Compose
Made a docker file in order to be able to run the SQL database, the files were removed from the Visual Studio solution, since they are running in the background they don't need to be there.

## Razor Pages
We also decided on using the same flow chart for the Razor Pages to guide our [Main Menu, New Game, Load, and history](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-group-2/blob/main/Documentation/Ludo%20-%20Menu.jpg)

Along with [Flow chart for Ludo Game](https://github.com/PGBSNH20/ludo-v2-group-2/blob/main/Documentation/Ludo%20-%20Basic%20Game%20Flow.jpg)
