First we took 2 days to try to come up with an idea as to how to seperate the project or how to do this project. Then we met up and decided to go with starting up with Alejandra's project file, which had the start up files along with the docker compose

We will have Main, then one branch for Anas, and one branch for Alejandra, we split up the controllers duties. Anas will figure out the controllers for Winners and Players. And Alejandra will take responsibility for Boards, Colors, and BoardStates controllers. 

We also decided that referring to **Razor Pages** Anas will be starting with Main menu, and New Game. And Alejandra will be starting with Ludo Game page. We have left **2** of the pages that we have planned unasigned (Load page, and History page), whoever finishes will take the next one and work on them.
